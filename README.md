# EXPAnDDR
The EXPAnDDR adds a BOOT PROM socket, a parallel port, and a memory expansion board addressor port to your ADAM computer.

This is a cost reduced design with easily accessible through-hole components for the DIYer that wants to experiment with available BOOT PROMs, to diagnose
a faulty ADAM computer, use a parallel printer or needs a cheap memory addressor for expanded memory.
